description: "Certain Personal Matters is an 1897 collection of essays selected by\
  \ H. G. Wells from among the many short essays and ephemeral pieces he had written\
  \ since 1893. The book consists of thirty-nine pieces ranging from about eight hundred\
  \ to two thousand words in length. A one-shilling reprint (two shillings in cloth)\
  \ was issued in 1901 by T. Fisher Unwin.\nThe essays in Certain Personal Matters\
  \ are written from a consistent first-person perspective, but only one (ironically,\
  \ given the title) describes an identifiable event in Wells's lifeâ€”how he responded\
  \ to being diagnosed with tuberculosis in the fall of 1887.\nThe other essays adopt\
  \ the playful persona of an aspiring young writer living in modest circumstances\
  \ with a wife, Euphemia, who is only sketchily and obliquely described. Their tone\
  \ reflects the demands of the market in London magazines for \"short essays, or\
  \ short stories, often with a twist, which can be read in half a dozen minutes,\
  \ but which will pique a reader's attention and ultimately allow him to think, 'How\
  \ true. I have done that myself', or to make some similar remark.\"\nMore than half\
  \ of the essays are humorous social satire; serious subjects are addressed only\
  \ ironically. Politics, historical and economic topics, and identifiable portraiture\
  \ are eschewed. Ten essays have literary themes, and in these, too, the point of\
  \ view is humorous. One (\"On Schooling and the Phases of Mr. Sandsome\") gently\
  \ critiques the choice of subjects studied in the course of primary and secondary\
  \ education. Half a dozen essays engage scientific themes, especially natural selection\
  \ and evolution, and in \"The Extinction of Man\" Wells shows he is contemplating\
  \ themes that would be expressed in his next novel, The War of the Worlds: \"Even\
  \ now, for all we can tell, the coming terror may be crouching for its spring and\
  \ the fall of humanity may be at hand.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
